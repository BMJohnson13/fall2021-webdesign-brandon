            The JavaScript Way is a free publication. This eBook is written for beginners to learn the basic fundamentals of JavaScript. The author, Baptiste Pesquet, is a teacher who has experience with hundreds of students which, in my opinion, gives him a perspective and style of writing that caters to the struggles of students and beginners.
