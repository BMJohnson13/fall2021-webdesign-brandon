<p>This is a paragraph</p>

<!-- **IMPORTANT** although the alt description is not required for your code to be read correctly, ALWAYS use it and use it correctly. It enables accesability features for those that need them-->

<!-- this is NOT how to make an image element -->
<!-- <img>myimage.jpg</img> -->

<!-- The CORRECT way of making an image element (ends with "end" comment) -->
<!-- img is a SELF-CLOSING tag, it has no closing tag, it closes itself! -->
<!-- src is an attribute, attributes are ADDITIONAL pieces of information for an element. Attributes can ONLY go inside of the OPENING tag. -->

<img src="images/tattoos.jpg" alt="a tattoo artist in black gloves doing a geometric pattern of triangles on their client." />
<!-- end -->


<!-- example of a bad alt descriptipon. it should be describing the FILE and NOT the contents of the file. *don't describe the file itself with it's format or file extention, describe what the file actually is in more of a physical description of the file-->
<img src="images/pexels-cottonbro-4123584.jpg" alt="A jpeg image" />


<!-- example of a bad descriptipon, the description is assuming or suggesting something not related to the image -->
<img src="images/pexels-cottonbro-4125508.jpg" alt="the tattoo artist is annoyed with his impatient client" title="drawing a dragon"/>
<!-- *note- visual code will automatically suggest any files in its current folder after a src="_" -->

<!-- anchor element, allows a piece of text to go to a dirrerent web page -->

<!-- This anchor element is using URL mode, meaning its going to another WEBSITE. -->
<p>This is a very long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo">scentence</a> that is going to be used for creating links</p>

<!--example of a url mode attatching the link to the title of or name of the website-->
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>

<!-- This anchor element is using File mode meaning its going to another file-->
<p>Check out my <a href="firstwebpage.html">first web page!</a></p>
